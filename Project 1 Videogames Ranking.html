        <h1>The best videogames according to Nestor</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 best videogames of all time</h2>

        <h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
             <p>
            Going back to the end of the wild west we encarnate Arthur Morgan. Second in command of the Van Der Linde Gang whose leader of course is Dutch Van Der Linde. <br />
            The story will take you to the last days of the outlaws as the wild west is coming to an end, but the law is not going to be your only concern as you will not only face the end of an era but put to the test the trust between your own.

        <h3>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h3>
            <p>
            Straight out of Hidetaka Mijazaki's Mind, Sekiro is a new approach to his classic formula of Souls Games. Leaving the RPG elements for a more action/adventure game where you will face unforgiving challenges as now you will depend only in your own skill and learing to win.<br />
            Sekiro is not about levels or strategies but rather rythm and relfexes, of course this can be said about all FromSoftware games but this time it's at it's peak, as you won't be able to rely on heavy armor or shields, only your own katana and skill as a trained Shinobi.

        <h3>Call Of Duty: Black Ops</h3>
            <p>
            As part of a anual saga, the COD games were always known by it's multiplayer, specially in recent days where even the Zombies mode has made a name on the larger community. However, people have forgotten that these games also have a story mode wich is responsible for introducing the game mechanics and theme.<br />
            Of all campaigns in the 20+ years of Call Of Duty, I consider this the best as it introduces you to the Cold War for the first time in the saga and does it in a particular way by not focusing on the great battles as previos games, but rather follows the story of a single man, Alex Mason.
